Global Sea Surface Temperature Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes sea surface temperature 
changes across various locations around the world. By examining 
individual sites and then aggregating the data, we can gain a 
clearer understanding of global ocean warming trends.

To explore the data, I created several visual models, including 
trend lines that highlight temperature changes over time.

The data analysis was primarily conducted using Tableau, while 
data import and initial processing were performed in Microsoft 
Excel. Data cleaning was completed using SQL.

All data for the project was provided by Bio Interactive.
